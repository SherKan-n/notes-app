# Notes Web Appplication - JavaScript Modules

Notes Web Appplication is a web application built using JavaScript modules that allows you to take notes in five different categories: informative, urgent, important, normal, and completed. The informative notes help you organize your ideas and remember information, the urgent notes alert you about tasks that need to be completed as soon as possible, the important notes help you focus on essential tasks, the normal notes are the most frequent and help you organize your day-to-day work, and the completed notes allow you to mark completed tasks and remove them from the list.

This website also allows you to create folders to organize your notes in the way you want to see them. For example, you can create folders for office tasks, personal projects, or home tasks.

Registration and authentication on the website allow you to save your notes and folders and access them from anywhere. In addition, we have an intuitive and easy-to-use interface that allows you to add, edit, or delete notes and folders with ease.
